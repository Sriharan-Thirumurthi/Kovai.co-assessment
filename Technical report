I have used Prophet, it is an open source library used particularly for time series models. And it is easy to forecast for the next 7 days for each services that has been produced as the output in collab file
It is particularly effective for handling data with clear seasonal patterns, trends, and missing values.
These are the steps to be followed to use Prophet library in Python

Input data must have two columns: ds (date) and y (target variable).

Initialize the model with optional parameters (growth, seasonality_mode, etc.).

Use the fit() method to train the model on historical data.
Generate future dates using make_future_dataframe().
Use the predict() method to forecast values.

Visualization:
plotting functions (plot() and plot_components()) to visualize forecasts and decomposed components (trend, seasonality, holidays).
